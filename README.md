# Text Editor - Windows Forms

This application is a text editor written in C# and Windows Forms as part of my college class final project in 2016. Other projects
for the final project included:
* Simple login program using a SQL local database with Visual Studio
* Simple implementation of a file watcher program that watched a source directory for changes and published the changes to the destination directory
* Basic application that connects to a ftp server and does simple operations such as read contents in a directory, upload a file, and delete a file.
